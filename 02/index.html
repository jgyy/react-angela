    <h2>Personal Site</h2>
    <p><em>Hi, I'm Ling Yi, a student from Singapore. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the
            <strong><a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>.</strong></em></p>
    <p>I have been interested in computers since I was a kid. I started off by learning how to use Windows and then
        moved on to using Linux. I have also built my own computer and learned how to code. I am currently pursuing a
        degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I hope to learn more about Artificial
        Intelligence and Machine Learning in the future.</p>
